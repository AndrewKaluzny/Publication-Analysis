In an interview with “The Breakfast Club” Tuesday morning, rapper Cardi B explains why she resisted pressure to abort her unborn child, who was an unplanned pregnancy.



After revealing her pregnancy over the weekend on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” Cardi B admitted in the radio interview that she briefly considered getting an abortion, but didn’t want to regret it. After saying she “kinda sort of” thought about aborting her child, she said she ultimately decided she “didn’t want to deal with the whole abortion thing.”

“I just didn’t want to,” she said.

Co-host Charlemagne Tha God replied: “The regret of it, probably?”

“Yeah,” she said. “I just didn’t want to. It was just like, ‘You know what, I’m a grown woman. I’m 25 years old. I’m say this in the most humble way — I’m a schmillionaire. You know what I’m saying? I’m prepared for this.'”

The “Bodak Yellow” rapper said she’s been disappointed at the response from some women who asserted her career is over now that she’s pregnant.

“It really bothers me and it disgusts me because I see a lot of women online like, ‘Oh I feel sorry for you! Now your career is over!'” she said. “Why can’t I have both? Why do I gotta chose a career or a baby? Like why can’t I have both?”
